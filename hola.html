        <p>Deer Tick is an American alternative rock band from Providence, Rhode Island composed of singer-songwriter John J. McCauley, guitarist Ian O'Neil, bassist Chris Ryan and drummer Dennis Ryan.<br>
            <br>
            The band's music has been described as rock with folk, blues and country influences, although the band actively rebels against the country tag, stating "We’re proud not to sing with a twang".<br> The band regularly perform cover versions in their live sets, including songs by the likes of The Replacements, Nirvana, John Prine,<br> 
            <br>
            Hank Williams, the Beastie Boys, Warren Zevon and Sonny West. They have also performed entire sets as Deervana, a Nirvana tribute band including a show in September 2013 to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's third album In Utero.<br>
            <br>        
            McCauley explained that inspiration for the name "Deer Tick" came while hiking in the Morgan–Monroe State Forest near Bloomington, Indiana in Summer 2005, where he found a deer tick on his scalp one evening, having never come into contact with one before despite having frequently gone camping and fishing as a child.<br>
